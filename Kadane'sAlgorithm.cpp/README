Kadane's Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array.
# SubArray
Sub array is a part of the array which contains elements contiguously.
A subarray must contain atleast one element, atmost it can contain all the elements of the array.

# Maximum Sum of The SubArray 
-Finding maximum sum of the elements in a subarray. 
-Using Brute Force approach the Time Complexity is O(n^3). 
-Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient approach where the Time Complexity is O(n).
