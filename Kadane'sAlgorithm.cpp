/*Kadane's Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array.
# SubArray
Sub array is a part of the array which contains elements contiguously.
A subarray must contain atleast one element, atmost it can contain all the elements of the array.


# Maximum Sum of The SubArray 
-Finding maximum sum of the elements in a subarray. 
-Using Brute Force approach the Time Complexity is O(n^3). 
-Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient approach where the Time Complexity is O(n).


# Kadane's Algorithm
Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array .

Algortithm : 
-Defining a function MaxSum which takes array and its size as parameters.
-SubSum is the variable which keeps storing the sum of the subarray as we iterate through the elements of the array. it is initialised to zero.
-MaxSum is the variable which stores the maximum value of sum. 
-The value of SubSum is incremented further only if the previous value is positive, if it is negative we re-initialise the value of SubSum to zero.
-If the value of SubSum is greater than MaxSum then assign its value to MaxSum.
-Print the value of MaxSum.
